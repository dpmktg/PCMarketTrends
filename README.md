This tool allows you to find gaming trends from Steam users.

It will take 1000 followers from any given game, parse their library, and return the most common games in their library.

The results can then be used to define a communications or marketing strategy.

To run it, use the command python3 ./steamTrends.py in your terminal.

You will need to install the requests library from pip in order to run it.
